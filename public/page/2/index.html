My Thought I’ve often thought that using month-long challenges or sprints would be good as a congregation as it would give focus and still feels manageable.

    <h2>Dr. Grant Horner&#39;s Bible Reading System
    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Dr. Grant Horner’s Bible Reading System is, as the name implies, a system rather than a static plan that reads one chapter each day from ten different biblical genres.
Screenshot from video below Features As a result of restart each genre after completing the genre, each day has a new set of readings and texts to cross reference. (In this sense, this is a more of a perpetual system rather than a traditional plan (with concrete start and end dates).) Here’s how Dr. Horner puts it:

    <h2>Navigators Bible Reading Plan
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The Navigators Bible Reading Plan (PDF) (also known as Discipleship Journal Bible Reading Plan) offers the following features.
Features The following are taken from their site.
Provides flexibility with our new and refreshed format, you can begin whenever you like. You don’t have to wait for January 1 to start this plan; you can start whenever you like. Offers three to six free days per month. You’ll have 25 readings each month, which provides the space to catch up, if needed. Or you can return to passages where you want to spend more time. Adds variety in your daily readings as you daily journey through the Old and New Testament, offering four scripture passages daily. No more dragging your feet through a section of the Bible you find difficult to understand before you can move forward. Adapts to your Bible study needs. Does reading the entire Bible this year feel like too much? This plan promotes creating sacred space for you and the Lord to spend time together. My Thoughts Good mixture of Old Testament (including wisdom literature) and New Testament throughout the year. Good flexibility in including “free days” each month and having no set start date. However, given such flexibility, it would impossible to align with the church calendar. In addition, each day has a good amount of reading. Others’ Thoughts John Piper likes and uses this plan because (a) there are four different readings (thus it is more likely at least one of the readings is edifying) and (b) there are catch-up days. (Note: similar to Dr. Donald Whitney’s thoughts.)

    <h2>The 5x5x5 New Testament Bible Reading Plan
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Read through the New Testament (PDF) in 5 days a week, 5 minutes a day.
Features The following are taken from their site.
If you’re not used to reading the Bible daily, start with this easy to use tool to read a chapter of the New Testament in 5 minutes a day. This reading plan will take you through all 260 chapters of the New Testament, one chapter per day. The Gospels are read throughout the year to weave in the story of Christ all year long. Determine a time and location to spend 5 minutes a day for 5 days a week. It is best to have a consistent time and a quiet place where you can regularly meet with the Lord. My Thoughts A very accessible and manageable way to read through the New Testament. Nice to see the Gospels read at different points in the year. Given the five-day rhythm, perhaps the Five Day Bible Reading Plan would be the natural next plan? </p>

    <h2>The Book-at-a-Time Bible Reading Plan
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The Navigators Book-at-a-Time Bible Reading Plan (PDF) takes you through the entire Bible in one year, providing two readings for each day.
Features The following are taken from their site.
The first reading alternates between Old and New Testament books with the Gospels spread throughout the year. The second reading takes you through a chapter of the wisdom literature and Isaiah. You can begin at any point of the year. Each month consists of twenty-five readings. You’ll have a few extra days each month to meditate more deeply on something that was significant to you in the past week, to catch up on missed readings, or to revisit favorite passages. If reading through the entire Bible in one year looms as too large a task, you can alter the plan to meet your needs. For example, you could read the first reading this year and the second reading next year. My Thoughts Good mixture of Old Testament and New Testament throughout the year. (Although, there are some months with long stretches of only the Old Testament.) Good flexibility in including “free days” each month and having no set start date. In contrast to the Navigators Bible Reading Plan (PDF), this plan seems to have more focus as a result of focusing on just two books at time. I’m not sure the rationale behind the ordering of the minor prophets. At first I thought it was chronological, but that doesn’t seem to be the case (see Month 12). Does not align with the church calendar and has a good amount of reading each day. Others’ Thoughts </p>
