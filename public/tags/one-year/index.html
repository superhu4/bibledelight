Features Each day features a reading from the Old Testament, New Testament, and Psalm or Proverb. Entries begin with a very short summary of that day’s readings. Entries are also undated.

    <h2>DUMC Bible Reading Plans
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Damansara Utama Methodist Church in Malaysia has a number of thoughtful annual Bible reading plans in line with their annual theme.
Features Five days a week Typically one chapter per day Thoughtful arrangement of readings For example, when reading the Psalms in 2024, “[w]here possible, David’s psalms are generally set in the context of the history of Israel and the events of his life, thereby giving us a rare glimpse into both the outward actions and inner life of David.” (source) Further, a “special Easter week reading will feature passages in the Psalms quoted by Jesus.” (Ibid.) (Note: This is not the case in 2025.) 2025’s plan is a journey through the narratives of the Bible. (Similar to 5 Day Bible Narratives?) 2025 looks to include excerpts from Christian history on Saturdays. My Thoughts I so appreciate the intentional customization done for this church community – as well as their perseverance in providing a unique plan each year. Does not follow the church calendar. </p>

    <h2>5 Day Bible Narratives

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>5 Day Bible Narratives follows the narrative of the entire Bible.
Features Read through all of the major narratives of Scripture, plus Psalm and Proverbs, in a year. Read only 5 days per week. Perfect especially for children, families, or individuals who wish to focus a year’s reading only on the Bible’s narratives. Related: Tune My Heart: Bible Narratives Devotional Guide for Families or Individuals The goal of this Bible narratives reading guide is to provide a resource that focuses on the narratives and poetry of Scripture. Scott Aniol has created a 52-week Bible reading plan that focuses only on the narratives of Scripture, along with all of the psalms and proverbs. Further, the plan schedules readings for five days per week, giving readers the weekend to catch up if they fall behind.

    <h2>Join the Journey
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Join The Journey (JTJ) is a realistic daily Bible-reading plan from Watermark Community Church that (at least in 2023) takes the reader from Genesis to Jesus.
Features Five days a week Extensive devotional support including podcasts and printed journals for adults and children. My Thoughts As described in the introduction of the Join the Journey Vol. 1 journal, this Join The Journey started in 2005. The lessons learned from nearly 20 years of experience shines through the thoughtfulness of the plan and supporting resources. Like other plans, I appreciate the weekday rhythm as well as the acknowledgment of the church calendar with unique readings for Holy Week and Advent. (This looks to be a new addition for 2023.) In addition, the devotional resources appear to be rich and artfully done. While the 2022 plan covered the New Testament, the 2023 the plan covers the Old Testament. Although this is a helpful balance to 2022’s focus, not reading any New Testament until Advent feels like a gap. </p>

    <p>2023 The Ten Minute Bible Talks Bible Reading Plan 2023 journeys through the New Testament in a year with a corresponding devotional podcast.
Features Five days a week Journeys through the New Testament in the following order: Matthew James 1 &amp; 2 Peter Jude Hebrews Luke Acts 1-14 Galatians Acts 15-18 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians Acts 19 1 &amp; 2 Corinthians Acts 20 Romans Acts 21-24 Colossians Philemon Ephesians Philippians Acts 25-28 Titus 1 &amp; 2 Timothy Mark Revelation 1, 2, 3 John John Helpful 10-minute podcast that explains and applies that day’s text My Thoughts Good weekly rhythm with concise and applicable podcast. (Reminds me of the Join the Journey podcast.) Does not explicitly acknowledge the church calendar. Thoughtful arrangement of the New Testament. Scattering the Gospels throughout the years keeps the account of Jesus fresh. Interspersing Paul’s epistles in the Acts narrative helps connect the dots. Here’s how they describe their order:

    <h2>Navigators Bible Reading Plan
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The Navigators Bible Reading Plan (PDF) (also known as Discipleship Journal Bible Reading Plan) offers the following features.
Features The following are taken from their site.
Provides flexibility with our new and refreshed format, you can begin whenever you like. You don’t have to wait for January 1 to start this plan; you can start whenever you like. Offers three to six free days per month. You’ll have 25 readings each month, which provides the space to catch up, if needed. Or you can return to passages where you want to spend more time. Adds variety in your daily readings as you daily journey through the Old and New Testament, offering four scripture passages daily. No more dragging your feet through a section of the Bible you find difficult to understand before you can move forward. Adapts to your Bible study needs. Does reading the entire Bible this year feel like too much? This plan promotes creating sacred space for you and the Lord to spend time together. My Thoughts Good mixture of Old Testament (including wisdom literature) and New Testament throughout the year. Good flexibility in including “free days” each month and having no set start date. However, given such flexibility, it would impossible to align with the church calendar. In addition, each day has a good amount of reading. Others’ Thoughts John Piper likes and uses this plan because (a) there are four different readings (thus it is more likely at least one of the readings is edifying) and (b) there are catch-up days. (Note: similar to Dr. Donald Whitney’s thoughts.)

    <h2>The 5x5x5 New Testament Bible Reading Plan
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Read through the New Testament (PDF) in 5 days a week, 5 minutes a day.
Features The following are taken from their site.
If you’re not used to reading the Bible daily, start with this easy to use tool to read a chapter of the New Testament in 5 minutes a day. This reading plan will take you through all 260 chapters of the New Testament, one chapter per day. The Gospels are read throughout the year to weave in the story of Christ all year long. Determine a time and location to spend 5 minutes a day for 5 days a week. It is best to have a consistent time and a quiet place where you can regularly meet with the Lord. My Thoughts A very accessible and manageable way to read through the New Testament. Nice to see the Gospels read at different points in the year. Given the five-day rhythm, perhaps the Five Day Bible Reading Plan would be the natural next plan? </p>
