&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://pricejh.com/readingplan/&amp;#34;&amp;gt;ReadingPlan&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; helps you track your progress as you read through the Bible. You can start a plan at any time, progressing at your own rate or on the schedule dictated by the plan. You can optionally link to an online bible site to see the plan&amp;amp;rsquo;s readings in the application&amp;amp;rsquo;s built-in web view, or open the reading in one of many native bible apps.&amp;amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From 2016 to 2020, we had a church app. It had sermons, events, and our Bible reading plan. However, the app never got traction and the company behind it phased out support for the app platform.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Further, after reading &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://www.nucleus.church/blog/church-app/&amp;#34;&amp;gt;this article&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, I thought it best to sunset the app.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, I still missed the ability to track Bible reading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://pricejh.com/readingplan/&amp;#34;&amp;gt;ReadingPlan&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; does a great job of filling that niche as it allows churches and organizations to upload their own plans by emailing the plan (uniquely formatted) to the app creator.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition to the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://pricejh.com/readingplan/&amp;#34;&amp;gt;ReadingPlan&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; app itself, the ReadingPlan website hosts &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://pricejh.com/readingplan/cplans/all_plans.html&amp;#34;&amp;gt;numerous plans&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; which can be added to the app or just browsed to get ideas and inspiration for your own Bible reading plan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
