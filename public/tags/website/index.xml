      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It often helpful to have a short commentary and suggested questions on a text. &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://www.biblereadingplan.org&amp;#34;&amp;gt;The Bible Reading Plan&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; provides both.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s how they describe their beginning and goal:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Bible Reading Plan (BRP) is an extension of Harris Creek Baptist Church in Waco, TX. It began in March 2020, shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic forced our church to move online and into smaller groups. We wanted to find a way to get our entire church on the same page, reading the same scriptures, processing the same passages, and applying the same truths to our lives. Our Equipping Team divided up Mark, the first book we studied.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What started as an idea in a brainstorming meeting has turned into a movement of God. We’ve heard stories of people who have spent their whole lives in church who are reading (and understanding) scripture for the first time. Life Groups are growing in their love of God’s word. Couples have created a new routine by doing a daily Bible study at the breakfast table together.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Making sense of a book (66 books, actually) compiled thousands of years ago written by 40 different authors can be a tall task. It’s the goal of the BRP that you’ll walk away each day with a greater understanding of what scripture says and how to apply it to your everyday life. Each day we want to show how God’s plan of redeeming the world plays out through each page of scripture.
