    <h2>DUMC Bible Reading Plans
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Damansara Utama Methodist Church in Malaysia has a number of thoughtful annual Bible reading plans in line with their annual theme.
Features Five days a week Typically one chapter per day Thoughtful arrangement of readings For example, when reading the Psalms in 2024, “[w]here possible, David’s psalms are generally set in the context of the history of Israel and the events of his life, thereby giving us a rare glimpse into both the outward actions and inner life of David.” (source) Further, a “special Easter week reading will feature passages in the Psalms quoted by Jesus.” (Ibid.) (Note: This is not the case in 2025.) 2025’s plan is a journey through the narratives of the Bible. (Similar to 5 Day Bible Narratives?) 2025 looks to include excerpts from Christian history on Saturdays. My Thoughts I so appreciate the intentional customization done for this church community – as well as their perseverance in providing a unique plan each year. Does not follow the church calendar. </p>

    <h2>My Seven-Year Plan for Reading the Bible
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Darry Dash writes …
Early in 2021, I started a new Bible reading plan. It will take me through the entire Bible in roughly seven years.
My plan is inspired by Nate Pickowicz and his book How to Eat Your Bible. “Instead of plowing through a few verses and then speeding off to work, slow it down. Instead of laboring through the whole Bible in a year, go a little deeper. Instead of reading your Bible simply to check it off the chore list, change your mental approach—change your philosophy. Instead, take a longer view of learning your Bible—two, three, five, or even seven years. Make your end goal not merely to read the Bible but to know and understand it—to love and treasure it as God’s holy, sufficient, transforming Word.”

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Mitch Maher (of Clarifying the Bible) shared the following plan to read through the New Testament in the month of December:
First - The Gospel of Luke and Acts. Luke wrote them both to Theophilus, and Acts “picks up” where the Gospel of Luke finishes.
Then - Paul’s letters (most likely) in the order that he wrote them. Galatians after his first journey. 1 and 2 Thessalonians on his second journey. 1 and 2 Corinthians and Romans on his third journey. Ephesians, Colossians, Philemon, and Philippians during his first Roman imprisonment. 1 Timothy and Titus after his release from imprisonment. 2 Timothy during his final Roman imprisonment before he was killed.

    <p>5 Day Bible Narratives follows the narrative of the entire Bible.
Features Read through all of the major narratives of Scripture, plus Psalm and Proverbs, in a year. Read only 5 days per week. Perfect especially for children, families, or individuals who wish to focus a year’s reading only on the Bible’s narratives. Related: Tune My Heart: Bible Narratives Devotional Guide for Families or Individuals The goal of this Bible narratives reading guide is to provide a resource that focuses on the narratives and poetry of Scripture. Scott Aniol has created a 52-week Bible reading plan that focuses only on the narratives of Scripture, along with all of the psalms and proverbs. Further, the plan schedules readings for five days per week, giving readers the weekend to catch up if they fall behind.

    <p>Daniel K. Eng writes:
It’s pretty simple: I stay in one book of the Bible for a month. During that month, I can spend time doing anything related to that book of the Bible. On a given day, this might be (1) reading a few chapters from that book, (2) meditating on a few verses, (3) reading a commentary or other resource, (4) listening to a podcast sermon, or a combination of them. At the start of the next month, I decide what book to read next, or perhaps stay in the same book longer.

    <h2>Our Church&#39;s Plan
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Goals When I was developing our church’s Bible reading plan, I had the following goals:
Provide a manageable (two readings each weekday; one of those readings being a Psalm or Proverb) diet of Scripture which (a) reads through books (or large portions of books) and (b) substantially reads the entire Bible over ~5 years.
Thoughtfully group books together by audience, author, timeline, etc.1
Satisfy three natural calendars (school, church, and solar) by starting in the Old Testament in late-summer (school) in order to lead up to messianic prophecies in Advent (church) which in turn naturally flows into the Gospels, Acts, and the epistles starting in January (solar). (In terms of preaching, I will generally focus on one Gospel at the beginning of each year based on a four-year cycle (Years A, B, C, D).2)

    <h2>Join the Journey
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Join The Journey (JTJ) is a realistic daily Bible-reading plan from Watermark Community Church that (at least in 2023) takes the reader from Genesis to Jesus.
Features Five days a week Extensive devotional support including podcasts and printed journals for adults and children. My Thoughts As described in the introduction of the Join the Journey Vol. 1 journal, this Join The Journey started in 2005. The lessons learned from nearly 20 years of experience shines through the thoughtfulness of the plan and supporting resources. Like other plans, I appreciate the weekday rhythm as well as the acknowledgment of the church calendar with unique readings for Holy Week and Advent. (This looks to be a new addition for 2023.) In addition, the devotional resources appear to be rich and artfully done. While the 2022 plan covered the New Testament, the 2023 the plan covers the Old Testament. Although this is a helpful balance to 2022’s focus, not reading any New Testament until Advent feels like a gap. </p>

Features Five days a week Journeys through the New Testament in the following order: Matthew James 1 &amp; 2 Peter Jude Hebrews Luke Acts 1-14 Galatians Acts 15-18 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians Acts 19 1 &amp; 2 Corinthians Acts 20 Romans Acts 21-24 Colossians Philemon Ephesians Philippians Acts 25-28 Titus 1 &amp; 2 Timothy Mark Revelation 1, 2, 3 John John Helpful 10-minute podcast that explains and applies that day’s text My Thoughts Good weekly rhythm with concise and applicable podcast. (Reminds me of the Join the Journey podcast.) Does not explicitly acknowledge the church calendar. Thoughtful arrangement of the New Testament. Scattering the Gospels throughout the years keeps the account of Jesus fresh. Interspersing Paul’s epistles in the Acts narrative helps connect the dots. Here’s how they describe their order:
