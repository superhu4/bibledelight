In this video, Dr. Donald Whitney gives reasons why one should use a Bible reading plan.

In addition, he shares his preferred plan which starts in Genesis, Joshua, Job, Isaiah, and Matthew. He also affirms the wisdom behind a plan that has days off each month.

Here is how Dr. Whitney describes this plan in his book "Spiritual disciples for the Christian Life":

> “My favorite plan involves reading in five places each day. I begin in Genesis (the Law), Joshua (History), Job (Poetry), Isaiah (the Prophets), and Matthew (the New Testament) and read an equal number of chapters in each section. A variation of this plan is to read in three places daily, starting in Genesis, Job, and Matthew, respectively. The three sections are roughly the same in length, so you will finish them all about the same time.
>
> The great advantage of such a design is in its variety. Many who intend to read straight through the Bible become confused in Leviticus, discouraged in Numbers, and give up completely by Deuteronomy. But when you are reading in more than one place each day, it’s easier to keep up the momentum.”
