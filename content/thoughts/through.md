The classic and most common approach to a Bible reading plan is to read straight [through](/tags/through) â€“ often starting in January.

While convenient, it keeps the reader outside of the New Testament until very late in the year. In addition, working through Leviticus in the dead of winter (at least in the northern hemisphere) is a double whammy that stifles many a good intention.

## Guardrails

That said, any plan and any Scripture intake is better that no plan and no Scripture intake!

Therefore, utilizing a companion [devotional](/tags/devotional) or reading in community can be helpful ways to overcome this challenge.  


## An Alternative

However, using a plan that does not proceed sequentially through Scripture is the most direct approach. Specifically, a plan that loosely follows the church calendar (such as the [daily office](/plans/daily-office/)) is a natural way to cover the scope of Scripture by taking in a healthy balance of both the Old and New Testament.

But this is not without its own challenges. ðŸ˜¬
