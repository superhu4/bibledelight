After years of being involved in preparing a Bible reading plan for our church, the following are my currently desired "core characteristics" for a plan.

- **5 days a week (Weekdays)** – This allowed catch-up on the weekends.
- **2 chapters a day** – Feels manageable for all. 
- **Through books of the Bible** – Read books as they were intended.
- **Follows church calendar** (esp. Christmas and Easter) – Provides preparation and focus.
- **Not "stuck" in Old Testament until end of year** – Gives significant weight to the all-important shaping of the New Testament. 

## Bonus Values

- **In YouVersion's Bible** – Many of our people use the Bible app
- **Devotional support** – Can be helpful in explaining and applying the text (and thus not being discouraged by not understanding)
