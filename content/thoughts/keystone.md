There seem to be five basic Bible reading plans:

1. [Through](/tags/through) the Bible – Classic and straightforward, but not without [challenges](/thoughts/through).

2. [Daily office lectionary](/plans/daily-office) – Based on, for example, The Book of Common Prayer (2019) of the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA). ([Fascinating article](https://northamanglican.com/a-new-daily-office-lectionary/) and [resources](https://anglicancompass.com/category/anglicanism/daily-office-prayer/) on the ACNA 2019 Daily Office.)

3. Thematic – Such as [those found at Bible.com](https://my.bible.com/reading-plans).

4. Customized – Like [Professor Horner's plan](https://bibleplan.org/plans/prof-horner/) which has 10 chapters per day.

5. DIY – Using a generic Bible [chart](https://visualunit.me/2010/12/14/bible-reading-chart/), [check sheet](https://bit.ly/3V4uAIu), [record](https://biblicalspirituality.org/article/bible-reading/), or app like BibleTracker ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-bible-tracker/id1530078172), [Android](https://bit.ly/3UA5Sz9)), Bible Reading Assistant ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bible-reading-assistant/id1473756195), [Android](https://bit.ly/3FxMfUr)), Tracks – Bible Companion ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tracks-bible-companion/id1231878723), [Android](https://bit.ly/3VZibpN)), or Daily Soul Bread ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-soul-bread/id1175130611)).
