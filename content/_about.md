Since 2011 I have been involved in preparing a Bible reading plan for our church. 


Over these years of attempting to thoughtfully assemble a plan that uniquely works for our people, I have had the opportunity to survey various Bible reading plans and explore related tools and thoughts. 


This site aims to help others delight in the Scriptures by sharing some of these findings.
