[Dr. Grant Horner's Bible Reading System](https://bibleplan.org/plans/prof-horner/) is, as the name implies, a system rather than a static plan that reads one chapter each day from ten different biblical genres.

## Features

- As a result of restart each genre after completing the genre, each day has a new set of readings and texts to cross reference. (In this sense, this is a more of a perpetual system rather than a traditional plan (with concrete start and end dates).)

Here's how Dr. Horner puts it:

> "You will NEVER read the same set of ten chapters 4 to 5 to five times each, the OT wisdom literature six times, all the Psalms at least twice, all the Proverbs as well as Acts a dozen times, and all the way through the OT History and Prophetic books about 1.5 times. Since the interweaving is constantly changing, you will experience the Bible commenting on *itself* in constantly changing ways ..." ([Source](http://grant-horner-bible-reading-plan-pdf.weebly.com/uploads/4/5/9/7/45977741/professor-grant-horners-bible-reading-system.pdf) (PDF))

- Further, because 10 chapters are read each day, "[m]oderate but consistent speed is the key." (Ibid.) That is, this is not a deep dive reading, but rather a "rapid, broad-scale contextualizing across both testaments and all the different biblical genres." (Ibid.)

## My Thoughts

- By reading nearly every biblical genre each day, I like how this plan benefits from a daily psalm and Gospel reading.
- Such a broad reading also facilitates connecting it to the church calendar. 
- Although a significant daily commitment, this plan is not tied to a date and is, as one author said, [forgiving](https://www.ingodsimage.com/2013/08/the-grant-horner-bible-reading-plan/) in that you simply pick up where you left off.
- That said, I think this would be difficult to read in community as a result of the challenge of staying in sync by not missing any days. 
- Good to see how others have adapted the plan (see below).
