[Read through the New Testament](https://www.navigators.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/navigators-5x5x5-new-testament-bible-reading-plan.pdf) (PDF) in 5 days a week, 5 minutes a day.


## Features

*The following are taken from their site.*

- If youâ€™re not used to reading the Bible daily, start with this easy to use tool to read a chapter of the New Testament in 5 minutes a day. This reading plan will take you through all 260 chapters of the New Testament, one chapter per day. The Gospels are read throughout the year to weave in the story of Christ all year long.
- Determine a time and location to spend 5 minutes a day for 5 days a week. It is best to have a consistent time and a quiet place where you can regularly meet with the Lord.

## My Thoughts
- A very accessible and manageable way to read through the New Testament. 
- Nice to see the Gospels read at different points in the year.
- Given the five-day rhythm, perhaps the [Five Day Bible Reading Plan](/plans/five) would be the natural next plan?
