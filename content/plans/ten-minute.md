## My Thoughts
- Good weekly rhythm with concise and applicable podcast. (Reminds me of the [Join the Journey](/plans/join) podcast.
- Thoughtful arrangement of the New Testament. Scattering the Gospels throughout the years keep the account of Jesus fresh. Interspersing Paul's epistles in the Acts narrative helps connect the dots.
- Does not explicitly acknowledge the church calendar.
