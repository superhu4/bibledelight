[Damansara Utama Methodist Church](https://dumc.my) in Malaysia has a number of thoughtful annual [Bible reading plans](https://dumc.my/bible-reading-plan/) in line with their annual theme.


## Features

- Five days a week
- Typically one chapter per day
- Thoughtful arrangement of readings
  - For example, when reading the Psalms in 2024, “[w]here  possible, David’s psalms are generally set in the context of the history of Israel and the events of his life, thereby giving us a rare glimpse into both the outward actions and inner life of David.” ([source](https://dumc.my/wp-content/uploads/BRP2024_A5_Flyer_SinglePg.pdf))
  - Further, a “special Easter week reading will feature passages in the Psalms quoted by Jesus.” (Ibid.) (Note: This is not the case in 2025.)
  - 2025’s plan is a journey through the narratives of the Bible. (Similar to [5 Day Bible Narratives](narratives/)?)
  - 2025 looks to include excerpts from Christian history on Saturdays.


## My Thoughts

- I so appreciate the intentional customization done for this church community – as well as their perseverance in providing a unique plan each year.
- Does not follow the church calendar.
