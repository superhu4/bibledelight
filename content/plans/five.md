> Last December, I went on a hunt for a new Bible reading plan. I wanted to find one that was 5 days a week (instead of the usual seven) and I was hoping to find one that was psuedo-chronological (more on what I mean by that in a moment). After searching a variety of websites, I came across this Bible reading plan that is my new favorite. I think it will be one that I use time and time again.

So much of are article resonated with my desired "[core characteristics](/thoughts/core)" of a Bible reading plan. For example, she also laments the [challenge](/thoughts/through) of simply reading through the Bible and highlights how the Five Day plan addresses this:

> However, the one downside of the chronological plan was that I didn’t get to the New Testament until October. I prefer a plan that allows me to read them side-by-side throughout the year. In this 5-day plan, the Old Testament is arranged chronologically, and there is a New Testament reading every day.

I encourage you to read the [rest of her article](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/melissa-kruger/my-favorite-bible-in-a-year-reading-plan-2/) as she does a great job describing the Five Day Bible Reading plan.


## Features

- Five days a week
- Pseudo-chronological
- [evotional support](https://www.fivedaybiblereading.com/readers-companion/) – However, I was not able to preview them on the site; I contacted the website owner about this, but to no avail.
- Available in [other languages](https://www.fivedaybiblereading.com/other-languages/) – However, not all have been updated to the current year.


## My Thoughts
- I like the simplicity and flexibility of its titular feature of five days of readings each week.
- In addition, like Melissa articulated in her article, I appreciate the pseudo-chronological weaving together of the texts *while* still keeping the reader in the New Testament.
- That said, each day covers a significant amount of chapters.
- Further, the plan is not directly tied to the church calendar. (However, since a Gospel is read each season, it would not be that difficult to connect to Lent and Easter. Further, the minor prophets and Revelation (read in the last five weeks of the year) can connect to Advent. One would need to be intentional about these connections.)
- This was the first Bible reading plan that I remember seeing a financial component connected to it.
