Searching for Bible reading plans will quickly yield a [plan](http://www.edginet.org/mcheyne/year_classic_single_letter.pdf) (PDF) developed by a young 19th c. Scottish pastor named [Robert Murray M'Cheyne](http://www.mcheyne.info) who wrote:

> "It has long been in my mind to prepare a scheme of Scripture reading, in which as many as were made willing by God might agree, so that the whole Bible might be read once by you in the year, and all might be feeding in the same portion of the green pasture at the same time." ([source](http://www.mcheyne.info/calendar.pdf) (PDF))

This plan journeys through the New Testament and Psalms twice and Old Testament once in a year by intertwining readings from four different books.


## Features

- As a result of reading from different books, Dr. D.A. Carson [writes](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/mcheyne-bible-reading-plan/) that this "reflects M’Cheyne’s view that Christians should read from more than one part of the Bible at a time. Not only will this help you link various passages in your mind, but it will help carry you through some of the parts of the Bible that are on first inspection somewhat leaner than others (e.g., 1 Chron. 1–12)."

- Offers flexibility as the four readings can be spread out over [two years](http://www.edginet.org/mcheyne/year_carson_a4.pdf).

- Excellent devotional support:
  - Dr. D.A. Carson has written [two](https://www.crossway.org/books/for-the-love-of-god-tpb-1/) [volumes](https://www.crossway.org/books/for-the-love-of-god-tpb/) which follow this plan. These are available in written and audio form on [The Gospel Coalition](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/read-the-bible/). (Note: see [his slight edits](http://www.edginet.org/mcheyne/info.html#carson) and [some insights](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/mcheyne-bible-reading-plan/) from him. Further, as of September 2022, Dr. Carson [hopes to complete the final two volumes](https://youtu.be/4eV0C0-edpg?t=1114).)

  - Paul Carter [utilizes this plan](https://ca.thegospelcoalition.org/columns/ad-fontes/5-good-reasons-use-rmm-bible-reading-plan-2018/) and also provides [devotional thoughts](https://intotheword.ca/getting-started) based on this plan.

  - Jacob Gerber does something similar at [Free Daily Bible Study](https://freedailybiblestudy.com).

  - Crossway offers the [ESV M'Cheyne Plan Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/esv-mcheyne-one-year-reading/id349167755?mt=2) and [YouVersion plan](https://my.bible.com/reading-plans/24).

  - Bible Society also offers [daily reflections](https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/explore-the-bible/daily-reflection/) which follow the M'Cheyne plan.

## My Thoughts

- Feels similar to the [Navigators Bible Reading Plan](/plans/navigators/) in that it reads four different genres each day. As a result, this helpfully keeps on in both the Old and New Testament throughout the year.

- Each day covers a significant number of chapters, and the plan has no catch-up days.

- Does not follow the church calendar.
