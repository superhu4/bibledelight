## Goals

When I was developing our church's Bible reading plan, I had the following goals:

1. Provide a manageable (two readings each weekday; one of those readings being a Psalm or Proverb) diet of Scripture which (a) reads through books (or large portions of books) and (b) substantially reads the entire Bible over ~5 years.

2. Thoughtfully group books together by audience, author, timeline, etc.[^1]

3. Satisfy three natural calendars (school, church, and solar) by starting in the Old Testament in late-summer (school) in order to lead up to messianic prophecies in Advent (church) which in turn naturally flows into the Gospels, Acts, and the epistles starting in January (solar). (In terms of preaching, I will generally focus one Gospel at the beginning of each year based on a four-year cycle (Years A, B, C, D).[^2])

## Basic Structure

Supporting these goals, I use the following structures to aid in creation of the plan:

- January until Holy Week: Gospels (and related New Testament books[^3]).
- Holy Week - Use plans from [Bible.com](https://my.bible.com/search/plans?q=lent) (including [this plan](https://my.bible.com/reading-plans/11399-jesuss-path-to-the-cross-an-8-day-devotional/day/1)) or from the [American Bible Society](https://americanbible.org/resources/daily-bible-reading/).
- After Holy Week through May: Acts and Epistles
- June and July: Freestyle (Old Testament wisdom and / or other Scripture)
- August through Christmas week: Pentateuch, History, and Prophets grouped on five-year rotation:[^4]
  - Year A: Genesis, Ezra, and Isaiah
  - Year B: Exodus, 1 Kings (or 2 Kings), and Ezekiel
  - Year C: Leviticus, 1 Samuel (or 2 Samuel), Jeremiah, and Lamentations
  - Year D: Numbers, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Daniel, and Hosea
  - Year E: Deuteronomy, 1 Chronicles (or 2 Chronicles), and Joel through Malachi.
- Christmas Week - Similar to Holy Week, use plans from [Bible.com](https://my.bible.com/search/plans?q=advent) or from the [American Bible Society](https://americanbible.org/resources/daily-bible-reading/).

## 2024 Example

*Note: The final version would include a daily psalm.*

### January 1 through March 22

2024 will be Year B for the Gospels and thus begin with the Gospel of Mark:

[![Mark, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, and Jude](/2024-1.png)](https://biblereadingplangenerator.com/?start=2024-01-01&total=35&format=calendar&order=traditional&daysofweek=2,3,4,5,6&books=MRK,1PE,2PE,JUD&lang=en&logic=chapters&checkbox=1&colors=1&dailypsalm=0&dailyproverb=0&otntoverlap=0&reverse=0&stats=0&dailystats=0&nodates=0)


The plan continues with two other Gospels:

[![Luke and John](/2024-2.png)](https://biblereadingplangenerator.com/?start=2024-02-05&total=46&format=calendar&order=traditional&daysofweek=2,3,4,5,6&books=LUK,JHN&lang=en&logic=chapters&checkbox=1&colors=1&dailypsalm=0&dailyproverb=0&otntoverlap=0&reverse=0&stats=0&dailystats=0&nodates=0)


### Holy Week

*Choose a series of Scriptures from a Lent Bible reading plan [such as this one](https://www.bible.com/en/reading-plans/36377) or [this one](https://my.bible.com/reading-plans/24340-family-holy-week-devotional).*

### April 1 through May 31

Acts and then 2 Corinthians through Colossians:

[![Acts, 2 Corinthians through Colossians](/2024-3.png)](https://biblereadingplangenerator.com/?start=2024-04-01&total=60&format=calendar&order=traditional&daysofweek=2,3,4,5,6&books=ACT,2CO,GAL,EPH,PHP,COL&lang=en&logic=chapters&checkbox=1&colors=1&dailypsalm=0&dailyproverb=0&otntoverlap=0&reverse=0&stats=0&dailystats=0&nodates=0)

### June 1 through July 31

*Freestyle: Scriptures TBD*

### August 1 through December 20

2024 will be Year D for the Old Testament and thus begin with Numbers:

[![Numbers, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Daniel, and Hosea](/2024-4.png)](https://biblereadingplangenerator.com/?start=2024-08-01&total=143&format=calendar&order=traditional&daysofweek=2,3,4,5,6&books=NUM,JOS,JDG,RUT,DAN,HOS&lang=en&logic=chapters&checkbox=1&colors=1&dailypsalm=0&dailyproverb=0&otntoverlap=0&reverse=0&stats=0&dailystats=0&nodates=0)

### Christmas Week

*Chose a series of Scriptures from an Advent Bible reading plan.*



[^1]: I got this idea from [Westminster Presbyterian Church's](https://www.solochristo.org)'s 4-year Bible reading plan ([PDF](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5294f36fe4b0f720804a928a/t/5c3e4f8b352f53dc97940a10/1547587468295/2019-2022+Bible+Reading+Plan+v.+1.1.pdf)): "The New Testament features a Gospel, followed by the books most associated with that Gospel. So Matthew’s Gospel, written with a Jewish audience in mind, is followed by the most Hebraic books of the NT, Hebrews and James. Mark’s Gospel, written under Peter’s authority, is followed by Peter’s two letters and Jude. Luke travelled with Paul, so his Gospel precedes Paul’s letters, and finally, John’s writings are grouped together." A similar approach is taken by the [Ten Minute Bible Talks Reading Plan 2023](https://bibledelight.com/plans/ten-minute/).

[^2]: This idea was adopted from the [Narrative Lectionary](https://www.workingpreacher.org/home-narrative-lectionary).
