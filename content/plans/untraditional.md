> Itâ€™s pretty simple: I stay in one book of the Bible for a month. During that month, I can spend time doing anything related to that book of the Bible. On a given day, this might be (1) reading a few chapters from that book, (2) meditating on a few verses, (3) reading a commentary or other resource, (4) listening to a podcast sermon, or a combination of them.  At the start of the next month, I decide what book to read next, or perhaps stay in the same book longer.


## Features

- Exposure to valuable resources
- Easy to user with someone else
- Support joy in God's word
- Allows lingering in certain places
- Keeps the biblical text saturating life 



## My Thoughts
- I appreciate the simplicity, thoughtfulness, and grace-filled realistic approach.
- One still needs discipline to regularly read.
