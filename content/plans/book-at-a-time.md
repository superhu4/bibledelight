The [Navigators Book-at-a-Time Bible Reading Plan](https://www.navigators.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/navigators-book-at-a-time-bible-reading-plan.pdf) (PDF) takes you through the entire Bible in one year, providing two readings for each day.


## Features

*The following are taken from their site.*

- The first reading alternates between Old and New Testament books with the Gospels spread throughout the year. The second reading takes you through a chapter of the wisdom literature and Isaiah.
- You can begin at any point of the year.
- Each month consists of twenty-five readings. Youâ€™ll have a few extra days each month to meditate more deeply on something that was significant to you in the past week, to catch up on missed readings, or to revisit favorite passages.
- If reading through the entire Bible in one year looms as too large a task, you can alter the plan to meet your needs. For example, you could read the first reading this year and the second reading next year.

## My Thoughts
- Good mixture of Old Testament and New Testament throughout the year. (Although, there are some months with long stretches of only the Old Testament.)
- Good flexibility in including "free days" each month and having no set start date.
- In contrast to the [Navigators Bible Reading Plan](https://www.navigators.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/navigators-bible-reading-plan.pdf) (PDF), this plan seems to have more focus as a result of focusing on just two books at time.
- I'm not sure the rationale behind the ordering of the minor prophets. At first I thought  it was chronological, but that doesn't seem to be the case (see Month 12).
- Does not align with the church calendar and has a good amount of reading each day.
