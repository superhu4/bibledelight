## Features
- Each day features a reading from the Old Testament, New Testament, and Psalm or Proverb.
- Entries begin with a very short summary of that dayâ€™s readings.
- Entries are also undated.

## My Thoughts
- Convenient to have in one book.
- Although covers the Bible in one year, readings always include both the Old and New Testaments. 
- Undated entries gives flexibility in start date as well as tempo.
- Does not follow the church calendar.
