## Features

- Read the entire New Testament in the first 70 days!
- Read the New Testament more than twice â€“ in [two different arbitrary orders](https://youtu.be/qhv4QIRSWaQ?t=183).
- The Old Testament starts with a summary.
- Alternate readings between Old and New Testaments.
- No straight through readings... it stays interesting all year long!
- Includes 10 days of shorter readings (I think for after December 23rd (when the formal plan concludes).)
- In contrast to the first version, each day is a predictable investment of ~15 minutes/day.
- [Early access](https://tearupyourbible.com) is available for $5 until December 23, 2022 â€“ then it is free.


## My Thoughts
- I so appreciate his zeal for Bible reading as well as his thoughtfulness in approaching preparing a Bible reading plan! ðŸ’¯
- The [challenge of reading the Bible straight through and his unique reading order as a solution](https://youtu.be/qhv4QIRSWaQ?t=151) definitely piqued my curiosity.
- Related, the alternation between the Old and New Testaments is something I've been considering to keep readers engaged. (And something which [Bible Reading Plan Generator](https://biblereadingplangenerator.com/) allows automatically.)
- The monetary connection is something the [Five Day Bible Reading Plan](https://www.fivedaybiblereading.com) also employs. 
- However, this is the first plan I've seen that has a referral program (see others' videos below).
- Having not seen the actual plan, I cannot comment on specifics. However, with my [core characteristics](/thoughts/core) in mind, my sense is that it is a significant daily investment and may not follow the church calendar.
