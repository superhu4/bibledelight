Mitch Maher (of [Clarifying the Bible](https://clarifyingthebible.com)) shared the following plan to read through the New Testament in the month of December:

> First - The Gospel of Luke and Acts. Luke wrote them both to Theophilus, and Acts "picks up" where the Gospel of Luke finishes.
> 
> Then - Paul's letters (most likely) in the order that he wrote them. Galatians after his first journey. 1 and 2 Thessalonians on his second journey. 1 and 2 Corinthians and Romans on his third journey. Ephesians, Colossians, Philemon, and Philippians during his first Roman imprisonment. 1 Timothy and Titus after his release from imprisonment. 2 Timothy during his final Roman imprisonment before he was killed.
> 
> Then - The Gospel of Matthew, James, and Hebrews. All three are written primarily to Jewish audiences and James shows great familiarity with the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7).
> 
> Then - The Gospel of Mark, 1 and 2 Peter, and Jude. Tradition tells us Mark leaned into Peter for material in his Gospel. and Jude shares similarities with 2 Peter.
> 
> Finally, The Gospel of John, 1, 2, and 3 John, and Revelation. The works of the Apostle John.

## Features

- By reading the entire New Testament in one month, one comprehensively traces the various New Testament themes.
- This plan gives careful thought to the sequence of readings (see above).


## My Thoughts
- Although a niche and very focused plan, it is a good Advent adventure and discipline.
