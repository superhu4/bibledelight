Instead of laboring through the whole Bible in a year, go a little deeper. Instead of reading your Bible simply to check it off the chore list, change your mental approach—change your philosophy. Instead, take a longer view of learning your Bible—two, three, five, or even seven years. Make your end goal not merely to read the Bible but to know and understand it—to love and treasure it as God’s holy, sufficient, transforming Word.”

Reminds me of [Daniel K. Eng’s](/plans/untraditional) plan — though even more free (as it is not constrained by the monthly rhythm).

As a result, my thought are similar.
