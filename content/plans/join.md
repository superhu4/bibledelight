*[Join The Journey (JTJ)](https://www.jointhejourney.com)* is a realistic daily Bible-reading plan from [Watermark Community Church](https://www.watermark.org) that (at least in 2023) takes the reader from Genesis to Jesus.


## Features

- Five days a week
- Extensive [devotional support](https://www.jointhejourney.com/resources) including podcasts and printed journals for adults and children.



## My Thoughts
- As described in the introduction of the [Join the Journey Vol. 1](https://www.amazon.com/Join-Journey-Journal-Vol-1/dp/B09NRGB47B/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1673552370&refinements=p_27%3AWatermark+Community+Church&s=books&sr=1-2&text=Watermark+Community+Church) journal, this *Join The Journey* started in 2005. The lessons learned from nearly 20 years of experience shines through the thoughtfulness of the plan and supporting resources.
- Like [other plans](/tags/five-days/), I appreciate the weekday rhythm as well as the acknowledgment of the church calendar with unique readings for Holy Week and Advent. (This looks to be a new addition for 2023.)
- In addition, the devotional resources appear to be rich and artfully done.
- While the 2022 plan covered the New Testament, the 2023 the plan covers the Old Testament. Although this is a helpful balance to 2022's focus, not reading any New Testament until Advent feels like a gap.
