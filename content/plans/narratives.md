> The goal of this Bible narratives reading guide is to provide a resource that focuses on the narratives and poetry of Scripture. Scott Aniol has created a 52-week Bible reading plan that focuses only on the narratives of Scripture, along with all of the psalms and proverbs. Further, the plan schedules readings for five days per week, giving readers the weekend to catch up if they fall behind.

> This guide includes notes, summaries, and questions for personal reflection or group discussion for each day’s readings. It also includes a 52-week catechism and a passage of Scripture to memorize and a hymn to sing each week.

> This resource could be used in a number of ways. An individual could use this for personal Bible study and meditation. The plan also works perfectly for upper elementary age children, and the study notes will help answer questions they might have. Parents could use this for family worship as well, reading the passages together and using the questions for discussion. The notes will also help the parents be able to answer questions their children (or they themselves!) might have as they read. Or a whole family could read through the plan together, parents and older children reading the passages individually earlier in the day and using the memory passages, hymns, catechisms, and reflection questions during family worship.

## My Thoughts
- Good option to cover the narrative of the Bible.
- Manageable amount of text to read each day.
- Many supporting resources which can be used in a variety of contexts.
- Doesn't follow the church calendar.
