The [Navigators Bible Reading Plan](https://www.navigators.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/navigators-bible-reading-plan.pdf) (PDF) (also known as Discipleship Journal Bible Reading Plan) offers the following features.

## Features

*The following are taken from their site.*

- Provides flexibility with our new and refreshed format, you can begin whenever you like. You don’t have to wait for January 1 to start this plan; you can start whenever you like.
- Offers three to six free days per month. You’ll have 25 readings each month, which provides the space to catch up, if needed. Or you can return to passages where you want to spend more time.
- Adds variety in your daily readings as you daily journey through the Old and New Testament, offering four scripture passages daily. No more dragging your feet through a section of the Bible you find difficult to understand before you can move forward.
- Adapts to your Bible study needs. Does reading the entire Bible this year feel like too much? This plan promotes creating sacred space for you and the Lord to spend time together.


## My Thoughts
- Good mixture of Old Testament (including wisdom literature) and New Testament throughout the year.
- Good flexibility in including "free days" each month and having no set start date.
- However, given such flexibility, it would impossible to align with the church calendar. In addition, each day has a good amount of reading. 

## Others' Thoughts

John Piper [likes and uses this plan](https://youtu.be/So61zHqhqZs?t=371) because (a) there are four different readings (thus it is more likely at least one of the readings is edifying) and (b) there are catch-up days. (Note: similar [Dr. Donald Whitney's thoughts](/thoughts/whitney).)
